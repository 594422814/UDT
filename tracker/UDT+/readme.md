After learning the feature extractor in an unsupervised manner, we combine it with the ECO method.

We **merely utilize our unsupervised model** without other hand-crafted features such as HOG and CN. Besides, we also do not use the factorized convolutional operator in ECO (i.e., the features are not compressed).

For more details, please refer to [ECO](https://github.com/martin-danelljan/ECO).
