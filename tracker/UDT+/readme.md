After learning the feature extractor in an unsupervised manner, we combine it to the ECO method.

We merely utilize our unsupervised model without other features such as HOG. Besides, we also do not use the factorized convolutional operator in ECO (i.e., the features are not compressed).

For more details, please refer to ECO [https://github.com/martin-danelljan/ECO].
